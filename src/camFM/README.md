# Camera Firmware Attestation

#### 1. Introduction

This project contains two sections: 

**DJI Tello Drone control** : In this section we will create a DJI Tello Drone controller program with the drone basic motion control, track edit function and drone motion safety check function. 

**Arduino firmware attestation**: In this section we will create a firmware program running on the ESP8266 Arduino to read the distances data from HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to do the fly environment monitoring and provide the sensor firmware attestation function by using the "PATT" algorithm to confirm the firmware is not changed by attacker.
