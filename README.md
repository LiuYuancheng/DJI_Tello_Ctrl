### Introduction

This project contains two sections: 

- DJI Tello Terrain Matching Drone Control 
- Arduino Firmware Attestation

#### DJI Tello Terrain Matching Drone Control 

In this project we add four additional distance detection sensor under a DJI Tello drone, then we use the Tello's bottom sensor and the 4 distance sensors to generate the drone bottom ground contour map, then our main drone controller will control the drone based on the contour map. For example, if we want the drone fly straight until detect a table sharp item under it, the drone will keep send the contour map to control program and if the program detect that the can match pre-saved table's feature, the control program will send the landing command to the drone. A typical terrain matching process is shown below :

In this section we will also create a DJI Tello Drone controller program with the drone basic motion control, track editing function, ground simple contour matching function and drone motion safety check function for user to plan complex route for the drone to follow.

#### Arduino Firmware Attestation

In this section we will create a firmware program running on the ESP8266 Arduino to read the distances data from four HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to do the fly environment monitoring, terrain matching function. We will follow part of the PLC firmware attestation algorithm introduced in the paper "PATT" PATT: Physics-based Attestation of Control Systems (from Dr.Hamid Reza Ghaeini and Professor Jianying Zhou)  to verify whether the firmware attack has happened. We will follow the "Nonce Storage and Hash Computation" part introduced in the paper to dynamically calculate the firmware's hamming hash with the `k=4` as shown below :

#### Key Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the attack

Based on the attack detailed road map above, there will be two kinds main TTP included in the firmware attack scenario : 

##### Malicious Firmware Development

- **Tactic:** Develop customized firmware with malicious functionality.
- **Technique:** Modify existing firmware or create new firmware that includes backdoors, exploits, or other malicious code.
- **Procedure:** The Red team attacker modified the normal drone's Terrain Matching unit's firmware by inserting malicious code into the firmware without detection, ensuring it remains hidden and does not trigger security mechanisms.

##### Supply Chain Compromise

- **Tactic:** Compromise the drone's firmware during the manufacturing or distribution process.
- **Technique:** Infiltrate the supply chain to insert malicious firmware before the drone reaches end-users.
- **Procedure:** The Red team build a fake software update server web site and send the link to the drone maintenance engineer via a fake drone firmware update email to introduce the compromised firmware into the supply chain. The web will also provide the Malicious Firmware's MD5 value for the maintenance engineer to do verify the unauthorized firmware update package.

### Background Knowledge 

Within this section, we aim to provide fundamental, general knowledge about each respective system and elucidate the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) associated with the attack vectors. This foundational information will serve as a primer for understanding the intricate details of the systems involved and the methodologies employed in the attack scenarios.

#### Firmware Attack

A **firmware attack** is any malicious code that enters your device by using a backdoor in the processorâ€™s software. Backdoors are paths in the code, which allow certain individuals to bypass security and enter the system. The backdoor normally goes undetected due to its intense complexity, but can result in serious consequences if exploited by [hackers](https://netacea.com/blog/crackers-arent-hackers/).

A common example of a firmware attack is an unauthorized update on your computer or phone that results in [malware](https://netacea.com/glossary/malware/) or some other form of cybercriminal activity. This is because many updates include backdoors with undocumented features or functions that can be used for adverse actions, such as intercepting data without notice and turning off core functionalities; all while still masquerading itself as an innocent update process.

#### DJI Tello Drone Control and Terrain Matching 

We installed four HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors under a DJI Tello Drone (as shown below), then we use a ESP8266 Arduino's GPIO pin (D1, D2, D3 ns D4) to connect to the sensor's data positive (+) pin and connect all the sensor data negative/basic (-) pin to GPIO pin D0. Then use the Arduino to read the distance data and average the data to get a stable 4 points drone bottom area contour map every 0.5 second.

![](doc/img/droneConnectrion.png)

We also provide a control program with all the trojan flight control function. The  ESP8266 will send the 4 points drone bottom area contour map back to the control program and combine with the drone's bottom height sensor's reading, then we build a 5 points  drone bottom area contour map: 

![](doc/img/TerrainMatching.png)

Then the control will compare the final drone bottom area contour map with the its pre-saved contour map, if the different in under the threshold, then the control program will detect the "Terrain Matched", after the Terrain Matched last for 2 seconds, the control will send the preset the flight action time line (rout plat book) to the drone. (such as instruct the drone landing on the surface)

### Program Usage/Execution

##### Run the Program

Follow the section "WIFI Connection Diagram" to connect to the sensor and drone to your computer. Then execute the program telloRun.py under `src` folder by the below command: 

```
python telloRun.py
```

After the program initialization finished, the below message will show in your terminal: 

```
"Program init finished."
```

 Then the main UI will show as below: 

![](doc/img/mainUI.png)



##### Control the drone, sensor and do the firmware attestation

1. Click the "**UAV Connect**" button under the title line, if the done responses correctly the "drone state" indicator in UI will change to green and the indicator will show "**UAV_Online**".

2. The sensor will connect to the program automatically. When the ESP8266 Arduino connected to the program, the sensor indicator will change to green and show "**SEN_Online**". 

3. Press the white '**Camera**' button under "**Takeoff and Cam Ctrl**" will turn on the drone's front camera.

4. The latest battery reading will be shown on the left-top corner of the front camera view panel and the height of the drone will be shown on the right side of the the lowest skyline horizontal indicator. The battery reading show in the title bar is the average reading in the passed 10 seconds. 

5. Drone track path planning: 
   - Add a track: Open the track record file "`TrackPath.txt`" (under `src` folder)  and add the track by below format:
   
  > TrackName**;**action 1**;**action x**;**action x**;**action x**;**action x**;**action x**;**land (example:*Track1;takeoff;command;up 30;ccw 30;up 30;ccw 30;up 30;land* .

     >  If you don't set the land cmd, the program will add the land cmd automatically. For the action setting part, please check the detail drone control protocol in Tello SDK Documentation EN_1.3_1122.pdf under doc folder ) 

   - Select the track in the drop down menu and click the "**Active track**" button, the selected track will by executed by the drone. The current executed action will be marked as green color. 

6. Sensor Firmware Attestation Control:  

   - Fill attestation times you want to do and the memory block size, then press the "**startPatt**" button. The local firmware and the sensor firmware will be shown and compared. The attestation result and total time used for the attestation process will be shown as below (The attestation process will take about 8sec ~ 10 sec): 

   - ![](doc/img/attestFail.jpg)

   - Every attestation result will be record in the "checkSumRecord.txt" (source folder) under format:
